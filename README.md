# Bayesian_linear_regression

In this work I have two questions for myself:

1. Shall I increase the time for which I sleep?
2. Am I correctly estimating my energy levels i.e. I used to feel pretty fine with 5 hours of sleep and now when I sleep for 6 hours there is a bias in my estimates towards lower fatigue?

I have tried to answer these questions using bayesian statistical approach.


### Packages that I am using:

PyMC3 for Bayesian
Arviz and Matplotlib for the visualisation
